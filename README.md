**This software was originally developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as Tiled WMS (https://github.com/nasajpl/tiledwms).  OnEarth is now the latest actively developed version (https://github.com/nasa-gibs/onearth).  The Meta Raster Format plugin for GDAL source code was split off into this repository.**

### NASA Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS)
## Meta Raster Format

The source code contains the Meta Raster Format (MRF) specification and plugin for GDAL, which is a part of the OnEarth software package.  OnEarth consists of image formatting and serving modules which facilitate the deployment of a web service capable of efficiently serving standards-based requests for georeferenced raster imagery at multiple spatial resolutions including, but not limited to, full spatial resolution.  The Meta Raster Format and OnEarth software were originally developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to serve global daily composites of MODIS imagery.  Since then, it has been deployed and repurposed in other installations, including at the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC) in support of the State of the Oceans (SOTO) visualization tool, the Lunar Mapping and Modeling Project (LMMP), and GIBS.
